This project aims to track new Wasmtime releases packaging them as publicly available OCI images hosted on the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io). New images are built using the latest stable version of rust for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64.

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/componentized/wasmtime:v36.0.10
```

The packages page on GitHub contains a [full list of available images](https://github.com/componentized/wasmtime/pkgs/container/wasmtime).
